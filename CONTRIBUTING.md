# So you wanna help out with the RatTracker?

I love it!

But, truth be told is that we're not currently looking for help with the actual code of this project. What we need is people with eye for UX, and feature-requests.

## How you can contribute to the RatTracker

You can fire your suggestion-limpets towards our [JIRA project](https://jira.fuelrats.com/projects/RTE/), where we keep track of all bugs, requests and suggestions!

Be sure to write as detailed as possible, so it's easier for us to work with these tickets.

_(Support tickets should also go this way)_

## Ground rules

-   Don't send a PR with code changes without any connection to a JIRA-ticket
-   If you find an issue within the code, open a ticket, so we can keep track of what's been done
-   If you find security flaws, don't open a ticket, send an email to support@fuelrats.com instead, if they match any of the following criteria
    -   I can inject data into the service
    -   There are modules used that contain known security flaws

## Ways to get blocked from contributing

-   Send PRs without opening tickets in JIRA
-   Openly speak about why "your code will be so much better"
-   Do unnecessary work (upgrade packages, change core code/settings)
