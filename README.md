And then click on the `rattracker-setup-<version>.exe` to start the download

## Running it

- First off, install the RatTracker by the instructions above
- Open the newly created shortcut "RatTracker"
- Authenticate with your Rat Account
- The Tracker should open and list current rescues and your own status

### Overlay

The overlay will only show if the game is active, and you are not focusing on anything in the game (Looking straight forward)

There are also instances, when the overlay won't start (for some reason).

The assigned rescue is clickable and will copy the system name onto your clipboard, so that you can enter the galaxy map and quickly enter the clients system into the search bar.
